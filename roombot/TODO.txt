RoomBot: Todo List


Big Picture:
	1. Make a working test level, w/ roomba and dust.
	2. Add upgrades / currency / progression.
	3. Add more rooms / roombas.

Next Steps:
	1. Roomba entity.
	2. Room to roll around in.
	3. Dust / dust collection.
	4. Profit.





Roomba Types:
	Corner Cleaner:
		Rectangular, makes 90 degree turns without rotating body, follows closely along walls.
		Basically just hugs the outside of the room and cleans the edge.
	Laser Roomba:
		Cleans one section at a time, we can easily animate a laser scrolling back and forth, zapping away filth.
		Could also be a 'full-room' cleaning, which has a very long cooldown / is slow?
	Circler Roomba:
		Constantly turns, slowly shifting between left and right turns.
		Kinda does circular curves, scrapes along walls.
		Bounce on wall touch like basic roomba?


Roomba Interaction:
	Roombas get some on-click function?
		Basic roomba: Toggles turn direction between left and right.
		Corner Cleaner: Reverses direction (clockwise/counterclockwise)
		?: Clean in a bigger AoE, on cooldown.
		?: Speed up and pingpong around, on cooldown?
