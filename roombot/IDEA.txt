RoomBot: Idea List

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Roomba Types:
	Different styles of roomba.

	---------------------------------------
	SIMPLE ROOMBAS:
		These are basic roombas which have very easy-to-implement behavior.

		~ Basic Roomba:
			Moves until it hits something, turns, continues.
			Not great with corners and complicated rooms.
			Not great at following the walls.
			Very satisfying WHEN it succeeds, because it kinda sucks.

		~ Corner Cleaner:
			Rectangular, makes 90 degree turns without rotating body, follows closely along walls.
			Basically just hugs the outside of the room and cleans the edge.
			Could get stuck in rooms with inward-angled corners.

		~ Micro Roomba:
			Smaller and faster.
			Does not 'stop and turn', instead it pingpongs around.
	
	---------------------------------------
	INTERMEDIATE ROOMBAS:
		These have more unique behavior, requiring a bit of thought / effort.
		
		~ Laser Roomba:
			Cleans one section at a time, we can easily animate a laser scrolling back and forth, zapping away filth.
			Could also be a 'full-room' cleaning, which has a very long cooldown / is slow?

		~ Circler Roomba: ?
			Constantly turns, slowly shifting between left and right turns.
			Kinda does circular curves, scrapes along walls.
			Bounce on wall touch like basic roomba?
		
		~ Mop Bucket Roomba:
			Moves to a dense patch of filth and sprays soapy water everywhere to clean a big AoE.
			Would look cool if little soap particles clean a small circle wherever they land.
				Probably not that difficult to implement either!
			Needs to recharge between activations.

		~ Incinerator Roomba:
			Uses a flamethrower to burn away 'debris', but creates black soot filth when it does this.
		
		~ Shredder Roomba:
			Uses a woodchipper/shredder to obliterate debris, but sprays out filth particles / smaller debris when it does this.

	---------------------------------------
	ADVANCED ROOMBAS:
		These have complicated behavior, more effort needed to get them working.

		~ Smart Roomba:
			Uses different movement logic.
			Options:
				Pathfinds around room in a set pattern.
				When turning, aims towards the densest nearby filth.

		~ Mothership Roomba:
			Moves slowly.
			Surrounded by smaller roomba drones.
				Drones could aim for dirtiest spots nearby.
				Or, just circle mothership, constantly cleaning.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Roomba Interaction:
	Roombas get some on-click function?

	~ Basic roomba: Toggles turn direction between left and right.

	~ Corner Cleaner: Reverses direction (clockwise/counterclockwise)

	~ Mop Bucket Roomba: Clean in a bigger AoE, on cooldown.

	?: Speed up and pingpong around, on cooldown?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dopamine Enhancers:
	Randomness to mix things up!

	---------------------------------------
	Temporary Powerups:
		Roombas can run over them and pick them up.

		~ Energy Drink Can:
			Speed buff

		~ Batteries:
			Cleaning AoE buff (Should roomba visually scale up?)
			AND/OR recharge roomba batteries?
		
		~ Cheese:
			Attracts rats and mice while sitting around on the floor.
			Once picked up, rats and mice come running out of the walls and dive straight into the roomba.

	---------------------------------------
	Random Events:
		Occasional events which create fun moments and additional filth.

		~ Slime mold:
			Temporary filth layer which grows outward constantly.
			Tries to maintain some level of coverage (~50/75% of the floor)
			Sort of a 'gold rush' event.

		~ Package delivery:
			Package flung through wall/window.
			Scatters glass/plaster/packing peanuts everywhere.
			Box could be larger debris.
			Occasionally/always happens when ordering upgrades/roombas/house-features.

		~ Shedding Season:
			Pets produce constant fur/filth for a duration.
			Scales with number of pets.
			Allergy bonus (sneezing everywhere)

		~ Leaky Ceiling:
			Filth appears under slowly growingleaks.
			New leaks keep appearing for a while.
			Ends with 'ceiling collapse', plaster/junk/debris all over the floor.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Home upgrades:
	A lived-in home is always filthier!

	---------------------------------------
	Furniture:
		Furniture is an obstacle, but also a filth nexus.
		NOTE: This would be a pain to implement, and maybe create too many issues.
			(i.e. trapped roombas, glitchy collision, bad pathfinding)

		~ Couch/Bed/Chair:
			Only some roombas can go under it.
			Builds more filth underneath / around.

		~ Table:
			More filth appears around a table.

		~ Rug:
			Attracts filth.
			Can be moved to reveal dense filth underneath.
			? Roomba movement is slightly affected while traveling across rugs ?

		~ Door / Pet Door:
			Creates more filth nearby.

		~ Litterbox:
			Dust everywhere.

	---------------------------------------
	Occupants:
		Living things are filthy.
		NOTE: The simplest implementation is just to increase passive filth generation.
			(Could also add more 'types' of filth, and different random events.)
		NOTE: Displaying occupants moving around would be a lot of pointless work.
			(At MOST, we could show 'shadows'/footprints, but that is still unnecessary I think).

		~ Cats:
			Creates fur, hairballs, feathers, poop/pee, cat litter, cat food.
			Shedding season events.
		
		~ Dogs:
			Creates fur, pawprints, drool, dog food, poop/pee.
			When raining, will 'shake' and spray mud/water everywhere.
			Shedding season events.
		
		~ Bird: ?
			Creates feathers, shredded paper, food, bird poop.
			Linked to birdcage furniture?
		
		~ Children/People: ?
			General filth.
